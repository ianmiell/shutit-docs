## ShutIt API

### Introduction

The shutit object represents a build with an associated config. In theory multiple builds could be represented within one run, but this is functionality yet to be implemented. 

Calling methods on the object effect and affect the build in various ways and help manage the build process for you.

### Configuration

Configuration is specified in .cnf files.

Default config is shown [here](https://github.com/ianmiell/shutit/blob/master/shutit_util.py#L55)
